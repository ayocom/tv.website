    <p>
        One of my favorite episodes is from season 5. It is titled 'Stress Relief' and in it one of the employees, Dwight, does a fire drill but one of the other employees, Stanley, has a heart attack. Eventually he comes back and the whole office is super nice to him. The boss, Michael Scott, tries to calm him down but he ends up finding out that he is the one stressing everyone out. This episode is good from the kind hearted nature of the rest of the office.

    <h2 id="cool">Dinner Party</h2>

    <p>Dinner Party is a great episode from season 4. It is about the boss inviting people over for a dinner party. The whole thing goes crazy when the boss is fighting with his girlfriend and unexpected guests show up. This episode makes the hairs on my arm stand up from the level of cringe but the episode is funny nonetheless.</p>
