    <p>
        My favorite character is Jim Halpert, played by John Krasinski. He is one of the main characters in the series and is really funny. He makes great jokes but also breaks the fourth wall by staring into the camera at funny/akward/scary moments. He is a good guy and makes the whole series really good.

    <h2>Michael Scott</h2>

    <p>Michael Scott is the boss of the office and is played by Steve Carell. He makes really good jokes and plays one of the dumber people of the office. He is a man with good intentions but sometimes they do not come off the right way. He really tries his best and makes the series even better.</p>
