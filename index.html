        The Office is an American TV Show that aired in the early 2000s. It starred Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski and many others. It is a comedy series and is still being replayed on television today.

        There are 9 seasons and each one gets progressively better! They add in new characters and different problms for them. Some of the humor is dry but it is a great show overall.

    <P>I really enjoy the office because it is funny, not super intense, and there are a lot of different episodes and characters. </P>
